ROADMAP (as of 6th of September, 2025)

Rebrand first (expect to complete this by like the 16th or so) then:
 - Actually add preview images for the games instead of having a shit ton of buttons
 - Revamp the site's entire design basically
 - Make the cloak function simpler
 - Reorganize a lot at the end (for example all the games should just be on /g/ instead of /assets/games/ ??? what was I doing half a year ago)

Merge every one of the like 36 other repos this site has as lazy dependencies into one making this like a 40GB repo, at that point I come to the realization "can I even host this shit on GitHub anymore" which takes us to
Host it on my own machine (Raspberry Pi)
Get better proxies instead of broken Ultraviolet forks
Buy 2 or 3 domains for the site (https://iili.io/KnZZkUx.png)
