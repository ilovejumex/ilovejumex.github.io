ROADMAP (as of 6th of September, 2025)

Rebrand first then:
 - Actually add preview images for the games instead of having a shit ton of buttons
 - Revamp the site's entire design basically
 - Make the cloak function simpler
 - Reorganize a lot at the end (for example all the games should just be on /g/ instead of /assets/games/ ??? what was I doing half a year ago)

Get better proxies instead of broken Ultraviolet forks
Buy 2 or 3 domains for the site
